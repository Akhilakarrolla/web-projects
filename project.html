        <h1>Drowsiness detection system using open CV and python</h1>
        <p>coming to my academic project drowsiness detection system using opencv and python,
            now days number of accidents due to drowsiness are very high.here our project is to build a system 
            which can alert the driver when he feels sleepy.this can be acheived using some image processing techniques
            where drivers face is monitoered using camera. </p>
            <p>facial processing to the face frame by frame .here facial landmarks are detected
            total 68 landmarks are present in our face.and eyes has its values in order sense the blinking period of the eyes we need to calculate eyeaspectratio.
            EAR value is different for normal blinking and when the person feels sleepy 
            so when ear values are matched to the sleepy condition then the alarm sound is played to alert the driver.
